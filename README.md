> [!TIP]
> **🚀 V2 Phase 2 Architecture Now Live**: Phase 2 architecture is active across **OWNd** and **MyHOME**! Featuring strongly typed CEN / CEN+ scenario command builders and device triggers (**P2**), Thermoregulation Central Unit (3550 / 4695) master mode and zone coordination (**P4**), Multi-Gateway routing and physical plant isolation (**P6**), DALI Tunable White support, and 100.0% test coverage verified against the OpenWebNet Golden Corpus.

---

## 🌟 Key Features & Modern V2 Architecture

- **Strongly Typed CEN / CEN+ Device Triggers & Addressing (P2)**: Native Home Assistant UI device triggers for scenario buttons with string-preserved addressing (`"0001"`, `"01"`, `"15"`), enriched event payloads (`where`, `gateway_mac`, `entry_id`), and all 8 press/release/held actions without requiring external YAML blueprints.
- **Native Hardware Bus Light & Switch Timers (`WHO=1`)**: Hardware-offloaded countdown timers executed directly on Legrand DIN actuators (F411, etc.) via `myhome.turn_on_timed` or native `timer`/`duration` parameters in `light.turn_on` and `switch.turn_on`. Supports standard Legrand preset codes (0.5s, 30s, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 15m) and custom Dimension 2 (`*#1*WHERE*#2*H*M*S##`) durations that turn off automatically even if Home Assistant restarts.
- **Real-World Gateway Trace Replay Fixtures in CI (P5)**: Automated pytest fixture engine (`tests/test_trace_replay.py`) replaying frozen on-wire bus captures from production gateways directly against the integration state machine, enabling deterministic bug reproduction and permanent regression defense for community beta testers without requiring physical hardware.
- **Thermoregulation Central Unit Coordination (P4)**: Dedicated master coordination for 99-zone Central Unit (`#0`, model `Central Unit (3550)`) and 4-zone Central Unit (`#0#1`, model `Central Unit (4695)`). Master Heating/Cooling switches (`*4*3xx*#0##`) propagate across internal dispatchers to subordinate zones (`standalone=False`), automatically synchronizing whole-home climate operations with physical central units.
- **Multi-Gateway Routing & Plant Isolation (P6)**: Namespaced event dispatchers (`f"myhome_cen_event_{mac}"`, `f"myhome_central_mode_{mac}"`) and device trigger filtering by parent gateway MAC (`via_device`), eliminating cross-talk and phantom triggers across physical plants combining multiple gateways (e.g. F454 + MH200N / MH201).
- **DALI Tunable White & Color Temperature**: Native support for DALI DT8 ballasts (F429 / F461 gateways) with auto-detection of color temperature (`ColorMode.COLOR_TEMP`, 2000K–6535K / mireds), seamless Kelvin/mireds conversion, and sentinel filtering.
- **Declarative Hardware Profiles**: Auto-detects and tunes connection limits and queue pacing specifically for your gateway model (`MH200`, `MH200N`, `MH202`, `F454`, `F455`, `AM4890`, `MyHomeServer1`, and `Legrand 3578`). Eliminates hardware session exhaustion and buffer overflows.
- **USB / Serial Gateway & OpenZigBee Support**: Native asynchronous transport for the **Legrand 3578 USB/Serial interface** via `pyserial-asyncio` with dynamic port discovery, authentication bypass, and OpenZigBee addressing (`<8-digit id>#9`).
- **Zero-Friction Migration**: Upgrades preserve all existing custom entity IDs (`light.keuken`, `cover.living`) and friendly names. Unique IDs migrate transparently (`MAC-WHERE` → `MAC-WHO-WHERE`) with no broken dashboards or automations.
- **Adaptive Inter-Frame Bus Pacing**: Hardened priority command queue with model-specific inter-frame delays (e.g. 150ms for legacy MH200 vs 20ms for F454) preventing command dropping during heavy automation bursts.
- **Dynamic Bus Auto-Discovery**: Automatically discovers entities from physical bus events and status sweeps without requiring manual `myhome.yaml` configuration. Full support for **F422 cross-bus routing** (e.g. `18#4#02`).
- **Sound System 2.0 & Audio Matrix (WHO=16)**: Complete multi-room audio support for F441 / F441M matrices and amplifiers, including zone power, volume normalization (0–31 scale), software mute emulation, and dynamic streaming proxy.
- **Streaming Audio Dynamic Proxy**: Seamlessly stream from **Music Assistant**, **Spotify Connect**, or any HA media player to wired BTicino audio zones using a thread-safe `DecoderPool` with analog gain-staging.
- **Dimmable Light Detection**: Auto-detects dimming capabilities directly from bus events with transition support.
- **OpenWebNet Golden Corpus Conformance**: Automated unit tests maintaining strict 100.0% line and branch coverage across all component modules, verified against multi-authority real-world captures across 11 OpenWebNet subsystems.

## 📦 Installation & Updating

> **Requires Home Assistant 2026.3 or newer** (Python 3.14 cores). Older cores stay on 2.0.0b12; see [Known Limitations](docs/configuration/known_limitations.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Never store backup copies inside `/config/custom_components/` (e.g. `myhome.backup`)!**  
> Home Assistant automatically discovers **all** subdirectories containing `manifest.json` under `/config/custom_components/`. If you create a backup folder like `/config/custom_components/myhome.backup` or rename the old directory in place:  
> 1. Home Assistant registers `custom_components.myhome.backup` as the integration module path for domain `myhome`.  
> 2. Python treats dots (`.`) as module delimiters, attempting to load `backup.py` from `custom_components.myhome`, which does not exist.  
> 3. Home Assistant startup fails with:  
>    `Setup failed for custom integration 'myhome': Unable to import component: No module named 'custom_components.myhome.backup'`  
> 
> **Rule:** Always keep safety backups **outside** the `custom_components/` folder (e.g. in `/config/myhome_backup/`).

> [!WARNING]
> **⚠️ Do NOT use HACS to install beta / pre-release versions!**  
> In **HACS 2.0+**, pre-release access was moved to Home Assistant entity switches (`switch.myhome_pre_release`) that are disabled by default. Due to upstream Home Assistant registry caching, enabling these switches frequently gets stuck in an *"unavailable"* loop or reverts to *"disabled"*. Furthermore, because pre-releases are built on the active development branch (`v2-phase1-architecture`) while the default branch is `master`, HACS download validation frequently fails with:  
> `The version 2.0.0b13 for this integration can not be used with HACS`  
> 
> **To avoid frustration, please use Method 1 (Terminal & SSH) or Method 2 (Manual) below — they take less than 10 seconds and preserve all existing devices, entities, and settings 100% safely.**

---

### Method 1: One-Liner via Terminal & SSH Add-on (⭐ Strongly Recommended)

If you have the **Terminal & SSH** add-on enabled in Home Assistant, open **Terminal** from the sidebar and paste this command (press **`Ctrl + Shift + V`** / **`Shift + Ctrl + V`** or right-click to paste into the web terminal):

```bash
cd /config/custom_components
# Move any legacy in-place backup out of custom_components to prevent loader crashes:
[ -d myhome.backup ] && mv myhome.backup /config/myhome_backup_old
# Create a safety backup in /config (outside custom_components) before updating:
[ -d myhome ] && rm -rf /config/myhome_backup && cp -r myhome /config/myhome_backup
# Download and install the latest v2.0.0b13 release:
rm -rf myhome
wget -O myhome_beta.zip https://github.com/OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME/releases/download/2.0.0b13/myhome.zip
unzip -q myhome_beta.zip -d myhome
rm myhome_beta.zip
ha core restart
```

*(For **Home Assistant Container / Docker**, run on your Docker host:)*
```bash
docker exec -it homeassistant bash -c 'cd /config/custom_components && [ -d myhome.backup ] && mv myhome.backup /config/myhome_backup_old; [ -d myhome ] && rm -rf /config/myhome_backup && cp -r myhome /config/myhome_backup; rm -rf myhome && wget -O myhome_beta.zip https://github.com/OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME/releases/download/2.0.0b13/myhome.zip && unzip -q myhome_beta.zip -d myhome && rm myhome_beta.zip'
docker restart homeassistant
```

> [!NOTE]
> All existing entity names, custom entity IDs, and gateway configurations are preserved automatically.

---

### Method 2: Manual Installation (Archive / Samba)

1. Download the release package:  
   👉 **[Download myhome.zip (v2.0.0b13)](https://github.com/OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME/releases/download/2.0.0b13/myhome.zip)** (or browse all [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME/releases))
2. Open your Home Assistant configuration directory (via **Samba Share**, **Studio Code Server**, or **File Editor** add-on).
3. **Important:** If you wish to back up your existing `myhome` folder first, copy it to `/config/myhome_backup/` (**outside** `custom_components/`). **Never rename or copy it to `custom_components/myhome.backup`.**
4. Extract `myhome.zip` directly into `/config/custom_components/myhome/` (overwriting the existing files).
5. Restart Home Assistant (**Settings → System → Restart**).

---

### Method 3: HACS (Not Recommended for Betas — Stable / Reference Only)

*(Available seamlessly once PR #232 is merged into master for the stable `v2.0.0` release)*

#### Step 1: Add the Organization Repository
1. Open **HACS** in your Home Assistant UI.
2. Click the **three dots (`⋮`)** in the top-right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
3. Add the repository details:
   - **Repository:** `https://github.com/OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME`
   - **Type / Category:** `Integration`
4. Click **Add**.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Migrating from a personal fork? DO NOT delete the MyHOME integration from Home Assistant Settings!**
> Deleting the integration from *Settings → Devices & Services* will wipe all configured gateways and devices.
> If you previously tracked a personal fork (such as `GreenGrassBlueOcean/MyHOME` or `anotherjulien/MyHOME`):
> 1. Open **HACS → ⋮ → Custom repositories**.
> 2. Click the **red trash can icon** next to the old fork URL to unlink it.
> 3. Verify `OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME` is present in the list.
> 4. All your configured devices, gateways, and automations remain 100% intact.

#### Step 2: Download & Restart
1. Open **HACS → Integrations → MyHome**.
2. Click the blue **Download** button (or `⋮` → **Redownload**).
3. Select the version and click **Download**.
4. Restart Home Assistant (**Settings → System → Restart**).

### 🩹 Troubleshooting: "No module named 'custom_components.myhome.backup'"

> More symptoms and fixes: [Troubleshooting guide](docs/configuration/troubleshooting.md).

If Home Assistant fails to load with the log error:
```text
Setup failed for custom integration 'myhome': Unable to import component: No module named 'custom_components.myhome.backup'
```
This is caused by a backup folder (`myhome.backup`) residing inside `/config/custom_components/`. Fix it by running:
```bash
mv /config/custom_components/myhome.backup /config/myhome_backup
ha core restart
```

---

### 🔄 Safe Rollback

If you ever need to revert to the legacy codebase (`0.9.4`):
- **Via HACS:** Open **MyHome** → click `⋮` → **Redownload** → select **`0.9.4`** → **Download** → Restart Home Assistant.
- **Via Terminal & SSH** *(use `Ctrl + Shift + V` to paste)*:
  ```bash
  cd /config/custom_components
  wget https://github.com/OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME/releases/download/0.9.4/myhome.zip -O myhome_legacy.zip
  rm -rf myhome
  unzip -q myhome_legacy.zip -d myhome
  rm myhome_legacy.zip
  ha core restart
  ```

### 🗑️ Removing the Integration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → MyHOME**, open the gateway entry's `⋮` menu and choose **Delete**. Repeat for every configured gateway. This closes the bus sessions, unloads all platforms and removes the gateway's devices and entities from the registries.
2. Restart Home Assistant if you also want to remove the code:
   - **HACS:** open **MyHome** in HACS → `⋮` → **Remove**.
   - **Manual / one-liner installs:** delete the folder:
     ```bash
     rm -rf /config/custom_components/myhome
     ha core restart
     ```
3. Optional clean-up the integration does not touch on its own:
   - `/config/myhome.yaml` — the legacy platform configuration file, if you used one.
   - **Settings → Dashboards → Resources**: the auto-registered `/myhome_static/myhome-bus-card.js` resource, and any `custom:myhome-openwebnet-bus-monitor` cards on your dashboards.
   - Automations and blueprints that reference `myhome.*` services or the `myhome_*` events (`myhome_cen_event`, `myhome_cenplus_event`, `myhome_message_event`, `myhome_cover_calibration`, …).

The gateway itself is not modified by installing or removing the integration; nothing needs to be reset on the OpenWebNet side.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Adding the Gateway

1. Navigate to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **MyHOME**.
3. Choose your gateway type:
   - **Network Gateway (TCP/IP)**:
     - **Auto-Discovery**: The integration automatically discovers UPnP/SSDP-compatible gateways on your local subnet (e.g. F454, MH202, MyHomeServer1). Discovered gateways appear in the Home Assistant UI with standard **Configure** and **Ignore** options, requiring explicit user confirmation before any config entry is created.
     - **Manual IP Setup**: For gateways without UPnP (e.g. MH200), enter the gateway IP address, port (default `20000`), MAC address, and OpenWebNet password (default `12345`).
   - **USB / Serial Gateway (Legrand 3578 / OpenZigBee)**:
     - Select your physical serial device (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `COM3`) from the dynamically populated port picker.
     - Select your baud rate (default `19200`).
     - Serial transport operates with zero authentication overhead (no IP password challenge needed) and natively routes OpenZigBee addresses (`<8-digit id>#9`).
4. Select or confirm your gateway hardware profile from the dropdown.

### Options Flow (Fine-Tuning)

Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → MyHOME → Configure** to fine-tune your installation:
- **Gateway Address & Password**: Update the gateway IP address or OpenWebNet password without recreating the integration.
- **Command Worker Count**: Adjust concurrent command sessions (1 to 10 workers, default 1).
- **Generate Bus Events (`myhome_message_event`)**: Enable firing raw OpenWebNet messages directly to the Home Assistant event bus for custom monitoring and blueprint automations.
- **Sweep group/area/general light addresses for status**: Enabled by default. After a group, area or general lighting command, the gateway is given a short (~250 ms) debounce window to echo each member's own status before the integration sweeps the group/area itself; disable this if your gateway needs a different cadence (see [Broadcast re-sync](docs/configuration/runtime_behaviour.md#-broadcast-re-sync-group--area--general)).
- **Light Transition Mode**: Select how brightness transitions are handled:
  - `software_stepped` *(Default & Recommended)*: Smooth 0.3s stepped fades interpolated in software, compatible with all MyHOME dimmers.
  - `native`: Passes through the OpenWebNet hardware speed parameter directly (for supported hardware dimmers).
- **Audio Decoders Pool**: Map network media players (Music Assistant, Spotify Connect, WiiM, Squeezelite) to physical matrix inputs 1–4 with per-source analog pre-gain offsets (0–50%).

---

### 📄 YAML Configuration & Zero-Friction Migration (`myhome.yaml`)

While the integration features **Dynamic Bus Auto-Discovery** that discovers devices automatically from bus events, existing configurations from older versions are 100% supported:

1. **Automatic Search Order**: The integration automatically locates your configuration file in:
   1. `/config/myhome.yaml` *(Standard HA config directory)*
   2. `/config/myhome/myhome.yaml`
   3. Custom component directory fallback
2. **Single & Multi-Gateway Syntax**:
   - Single gateway installations do not require a root MAC header; platforms are mapped automatically to your gateway.
   - Multi-gateway installations group platforms under their respective MAC addresses (`00:03:50:xx:xx:xx`).

```yaml
f454:
  mac: '00:03:50:xx:xx:xx'
  light:
    living_light:
      where: '11'
      name: Living Room Light
      dimmable: True
  cover:
    kitchen_shutter:
      where: '21'
      name: Kitchen Shutter
      travel_time: 22
  alarm_control_panel:
    central_alarm:
      where: '0'
      name: Central Alarm
```

3. **How names work** (Home Assistant's device / entity model): `name` names the **device** on the bus. A light, switch, cover, thermostat, audio zone or alarm panel *is* its device, so its entity carries the device name (`light.living_room_light`, friendly name *Living Room Light*). Sensors and binary sensors are features of their device and are named after their device class — a power meter named `House` gives `sensor.house_power` (*House Power*) and `sensor.house_energy`; a dry contact named `Cancello` with `class: opening` gives `binary_sensor.cancello_opening` (*Cancello Opening*). Use `entity_name` on a sensor or binary sensor to name the feature yourself (`entity_name: Contact` → *Front Door Contact*); an `entity_name` equal to `name` means "the entity is the device". Lock/unlock and calibration buttons are named *Lock*, *Unlock*, *Calibrate travel time* under their device. Entity ids are assigned once by the entity registry: **existing installations keep every entity id and every name you set in the UI**, and deleting the integration by accident is safe — Home Assistant keeps the registry entries for 30 days and restores names, areas and ids when the gateway is added again.

4. **DALI DT8 capabilities and `lock_features`**: a light learns dimming, tunable white (Dimension 14) and HSV colour (Dimension 12) from the bus as the frames arrive. BTicino DALI gateways (F429 / F461) remember any HSV or colour-temperature value that was ever written to an address - even to a fixture that cannot use it - and replay it on every status sweep, so a plain dimmer can end up with a colour wheel. Declare what the fixture really is and lock it:

```yaml
  light:
    rgbw_spot:
      where: '25'
      interface: '02'
      name: RGBW Spot
      dimmable: true
      color_temp: true      # Dimension 14 tunable white
      rgb: true             # Dimension 12 HSV colour (alias: hs)
      lock_features: true   # exactly these modes, never learn another one
    hallway_relay:
      where: '26'
      interface: '02'
      name: Hallway
      lock_features: true   # on/off only, whatever the gateway replays
```

Without `lock_features` the three flags are only the starting point and auto-detection stays on. Uncommissioned sentinels (`*12*511*127*255##`, `*14*1##`) are filtered by the protocol layer and never promote a light, locked or not.

**What a locked light does with a frame it is locked out of.** The frame is dropped as a whole - not just the colour, the HSV *value* (`*12*H*S*V##`) too. A dimension the gateway replays to an address that cannot use it carries no truth in any field: the value is whatever was once written, not the current level. Brightness is never affected by this, because it always arrives on Dimension 1 (`*#1*WHERE*1*<level>*<speed>##`), and a light declared with `rgb` or `color_temp` is implicitly dimmable. Every dropped frame is written to the log at `DEBUG` level - enable `custom_components.myhome: debug` in the logger configuration if a locked light does not follow the app the way you expect:

```text
GATEWAY light 26#4#02 is locked to ['onoff']; ignoring Dimension 12 frame *#1*26#4#02*12*353*74*80##
```

5. **Declared lighting groups (P7, #368)**: a `#G` `WHERE` (`#1` through `#255`) declares a group that **already exists in your plant** (configured with MyHOME_Suite or a physical group-programmed actuator) - it does not configure group membership on the bus, and it is not a second kind of "group" competing with Home Assistant's own `light.group`. Use it when you want a single OpenWebNet frame (`*1*1*#G##`, or `*#1*#G*#14*<mireds>##` for a DALI colour-temperature change) to reach every actuator programmed into that group at once:

```yaml
  light:
    living_room_group:
      where: '#6'
      name: Living Room Group
      dimmable: true
      color_temp: true
```

Without `members` the entity is `assumed_state`: Home Assistant shows separate On / Off controls instead of a toggle, because the integration has no way to know the group's actual state - only what was last sent to it. Add `members` (the point-to-point `WHERE` of each actuator in the group) to derive real state instead, the same way core's `light.group` averages its members' brightness / colour temperature / HS colour:

```yaml
  light:
    living_room_group:
      where: '#6'
      name: Living Room Group
      dimmable: true
      color_temp: true
      members: ['12', '13', '0114']   # each member's own light WHERE
```

`members` never sends a single extra frame - it only tells the integration which existing light entities to watch. A group with `members` still accepts direct control (single-frame `*1*1*#6##`); it also picks up a group dimension write the gateway echoes back (`*#1*#6*#14*153##`, the DALI case from #300). Never an auto-discovered entity for a group, area or general address (#368) - only a declared one.

### ⚡ Custom Services

The integration registers three specialized services under the `myhome` domain:

| Service | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **`myhome.send_message`** | `gateway` *(optional)*<br>`message` *(required)* | Send an arbitrary, validated OpenWebNet frame (e.g. `*1*0*0##`) directly to the SCS bus. Useful for scripts, custom diagnostic probes, and testing. |
| **`myhome.sync_time`** | `gateway` *(optional)* | Synchronizes the gateway's internal real-time clock with Home Assistant's local time using standard OpenWebNet date/time frames (WHO=13). |
| **`myhome.start_sending_instant_power`** | `entity_id` *(required)*<br>`duration` *(required)* | Requests high-frequency instant active power telemetry (W) from energy management counters (WHO=18) for `duration` seconds. |

---

### 🔔 Event Bus Automation Triggers

The integration fires native events to the Home Assistant event bus for automation triggers:

* **`myhome_cen_event` & `myhome_cenplus_event`**: Pushbutton events from physical CEN (`WHO=15`) and CEN+ (`WHO=25`) scenario controllers. Event payload includes:
  - `object`: Scenario button unit number
  - `pushbutton`: Pushbutton index (0–31)
  - `event`: Trigger action (`pushbutton_short_press`, `pushbutton_short_release`, `pushbutton_long_press`, `pushbutton_long_release`, or rotary dial `rotary_cw_slow`, `rotary_cw_fast`, `rotary_ccw_slow`, `rotary_ccw_fast`)
* **`myhome_alarm_event`**: State transitions emitted by burglar alarm systems (WHO=5), including partition `where`, `state`, `state_code`, and `is_alarm` flag.
* **Broadcast Subsystem Events**: Global and area broadcast commands are mirrored as:
  - `myhome_general_light_event`, `myhome_area_light_event`, `myhome_group_light_event`
  - `myhome_general_automation_event`, `myhome_area_automation_event`, `myhome_group_automation_event`
* **`myhome_message_event`**: When `Generate Bus Events` is enabled in Options Flow, every valid OpenWebNet message received from the gateway is broadcast to the event bus with `gateway` and raw frame `message`.

## 🎵 Multi-Room Audio & Dynamic Proxy

The BTicino sound system matrix (F441 / F441M) is an analog matrix switch. It routes physical source inputs (IN 1–4) to amplified room zones.

This integration includes a **Dynamic Proxy** that lets you stream IP audio (via Music Assistant, Spotify Connect, AirPlay, etc.) directly to your wired BTicino zones.

```

### Setting Up Streaming

1. Wire your network streamer (e.g. Raspberry Pi running squeezelite, WiiM, Cambridge Audio) to one of the matrix inputs (e.g. Source 1 or 2).
2. In Home Assistant, ensure the streamer is available as a `media_player` entity.
3. Open **MyHOME Options** (`Configure`), navigate to **Decoders**, and specify:
   - **Entity**: The streamer's `media_player` entity ID.
   - **Source**: The physical matrix input number (1–4) it is plugged into.
   - **Pre-Gain**: Analog offset percentage (recommended `15–20%` for line-level DACs, `0%` for fixed pre-amps).
4. Send audio from Music Assistant or Spotify to your BTicino zone entity:
   - The proxy automatically claims the decoder, wakes it, applies gain staging, and activates the zone.
   - When playback stops, the decoder is released back to the pool.

## 📡 Real-Time Bus Monitor & Diagnostics

The integration includes an in-band real-time bus monitor operating over the existing gateway event stream with zero extra socket connections:

### Lovelace Bus Monitor Card (`<myhome-openwebnet-bus-monitor>`)

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/myhome-bus-card.jpg" alt="MyHOME OpenWebNet Bus Monitor Lovelace Card" width="750">
</p>

A modern custom Lovelace element is automatically registered with zero configuration:

- **Visual Card Picker & GUI Editor**: Fully integrated with Home Assistant's card picker — simply search for **"MyHOME OpenWebNet Bus Monitor"** (or search **"MyHOME"** / **"OpenWebNet"**) under `+ Add Card` and configure the title or buffer size visually without touching raw YAML (YAML type `custom:myhome-openwebnet-bus-monitor`, with `custom:myhome-bus-card` supported as a backward-compatible alias).
- **Live Bus Stream**: High-performance scrolling feed with color-coded badges for subsystems (Lighting `WHO=1`, Automation `WHO=2`, Climate `WHO=4`, Sound `WHO=16`, Energy `WHO=18`, CEN `WHO=15/25`) and ACK (`*#*1##`) / NACK (`*#*0##`) highlighting.
- **Interactive Controls**: Live Pause/Resume, buffer clearing, and instant filtering by subsystem, WHERE address, and Direction (RX/TX).
- **Manual Frame Injector**: Send raw OpenWebNet diagnostic frames directly to the bus with syntax validation.
- **One-Click Diagnostic Bug Reporter**: Click **"📋 Copy Diagnostic Report"** to copy a sanitized, GitHub-ready Markdown bundle containing:
  - Home Assistant Core & integration versions
  - Hardware gateway profile, firmware, connection type, queue pacing, and worker counts
  - Live buffer depth and RX/TX counters
  - Collapsible OpenWebNet bus trace (`<details><summary>OpenWebNet Bus Trace</summary>`)
  - Direct link opening pre-filled GitHub Issue Forms!

> [!TIP]
> **Troubleshooting: Card not showing up or "Custom element doesn't exist"?**
> 
> 1. **Manual Resource Verification**: While the integration automatically registers the card resource, you can verify or manually add it under **Settings ➔ Dashboards ➔ Resources** (click the three dots ⋮ in the top-right corner):
>    - **URL:** `/myhome_static/myhome-bus-card.js`
>    - **Resource Type:** `JavaScript Module`
> 2. **Check for Conflicting HACS Cards**: If custom cards fail to load or the card picker spins indefinitely, inspect your browser console (`F12`). A common cause is conflicting or duplicate custom cards (e.g. having both `scheduler-card` and `lovelace-standalone-schedule-card` installed simultaneously). An uncaught `CustomElementRegistry` collision in an earlier card halts the browser's Lovelace resource-loading pipeline before subsequent cards can initialize. Removing the duplicate card resolves the blockage immediately.
> 3. **Hard Browser Refresh**: After adding resources or updating components, perform a hard refresh (`Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R`) to ensure the browser loads the latest JavaScript bundle from the gateway.

### 📝 Structured GitHub Issue Forms

When reporting issues or requesting new device support on GitHub, interactive forms ensure complete diagnostics:
- **Bug Report**: Gateway profile dropdown, connection type, HA version, diagnostics JSON attachment, and pre-formatted bus trace.
- **Device Support Request**: Structured form for adding new BTicino/Legrand modular components with WHO codes and frame samples.

### 🔍 Native Home Assistant Diagnostics

In addition to the real-time bus monitor card, the integration implements Home Assistant's native diagnostic provider (`diagnostics.py`).
To download a sanitized diagnostic bundle:
1. Navigate to **Settings → Devices & Services → MyHOME**.
2. Click the **three dots (`⋮`)** next to your gateway and select **Download diagnostics**.
3. All sensitive credentials, IP addresses, and tokens are automatically redacted via `CONF_PASSWORD` and `CONF_HOST` anonymizers before being saved to JSON.

### 🧪 Real-World Gateway Trace Replay & Community Issue Reproduction (P5)

A major CI infrastructure enhancement introduced for beta testing is the **Trace Replay Engine** (`tests/test_trace_replay.py`), enabling deterministic bug reproduction and permanent regression defense:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Beta Tester's Real Plant            │
│  (F454, MyHomeServer1, MH202, etc.)  │
└──────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                   │
                   │ 1-Click "📋 Copy Capture" in Bus Monitor Card
                   ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐

└──────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                   │
                   │ Saved to tests/fixtures/plants/<issue_id>/
                   ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐

│  - Replays 100% of frames in order   │
│  - Reproduces bug deterministically  │
│  - Permanent regression protection   │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### How it Works:
1. **Zero Hardware Needed for Bug Triage**: Legrand and BTicino manufacture dozens of gateway models (F454, MyHomeServer1, MH200N, MH202, 3578 USB) and modular DIN actuators with subtle firmware timing variations. When a beta tester reports unexpected behavior, clicking **"📋 Copy Capture"** on the Bus Monitor card (or downloading HA Diagnostics) packages the last 100 on-wire OpenWebNet frames with precise microsecond timestamps.
2. **Automated Discovery & Plant Setup**: Pytest automatically scans `tests/fixtures/plants/*/` for any directory containing `diagnostic_summary.json` and `myhome.yaml`.
3. **Sequential On-Wire Replay**: The harness initializes a simulated gateway session and streams the frozen frames sequentially into Home Assistant's internal event dispatcher (`f"myhome_message_{mac}"`), exercising the exact same message routing path as physical hardware.
4. **End-to-End State Verification**: Verifies that every single frame across Lighting (`WHO=1`), Automation (`WHO=2`), Thermoregulation (`WHO=4`), Audio (`WHO=16`), Energy (`WHO=18`), Dry Contacts (`WHO=25`), and ACK/NACK control signals updates entity states accurately with zero unhandled exceptions.
5. **High-Frequency Stress Testing**: Simulates event storms (e.g. 50 rapid toggle frames) to prove that the integration's async event queue and state machines never drop messages or trigger race conditions.
6. **Permanent CI Regression Protection**: Once a tester's trace is committed, it runs automatically on every pull request and push to master, ensuring that a fix for one community member's installation never regresses in future updates.

#### Capturing Traces:
- **In Home Assistant**: Call service `myhome.sweep_bus` -> Download Diagnostics (or copy trace from Bus Card).
- **Standalone CLI**: Run `python scripts/record_gateway_trace.py --host <IP> --password <PASS> --model <MODEL>` to record an isolated gateway on a test bench directly into a ready-to-test fixture.

#### Privacy: fixtures are synthetic
A diagnostics download describes a home: room and family names in `myhome.yaml`, the LAN address and MAC of the gateway, the config-entry id, sometimes a password. None of that is needed to replay a bus - only the addresses, platforms, options and frames are - so **every fixture is anonymized before it is committed**, and `tests/test_fixture_privacy.py` fails the build if one is not:

```bash
python scripts/anonymize_plant_fixture.py tests/fixtures/plants/issue_<n>_<model>
```

Devices become `light_10` / `Light 10` (the address is the name), IPs move to the `192.0.2.0/24` documentation range, MACs to `00:03:50:00:<issue>`, the entry id to a synthetic one, passwords to `null`. The script prints the old → new entity-id mapping for the test you write against the fixture. Name the directory after the issue and the gateway model, not after the reporter.

What the integration emits is clean at the source: the card's issue bundle and trace/sweep export name the transport and the gateway model, never the LAN address, the serial device or your browser; the diagnostics download redacts host, MAC, SSDP identity, config-file path, entry id and title, and names a decoder slot's media player `media_player.decoder_<n>` rather than after your room - in the config entry's `data` and `options` only; the gateway, profile, queue, platform and bus-monitor blocks are not touched, so every frame's `where` / `who` / `what` is there for triage. Two things still need the script: your `myhome.yaml` (it is your file, with your room names) and the envelope Home Assistant wraps around every diagnostics download (the list of installed integrations, `setup_times`), which is not ours to strip. `python scripts/anonymize_plant_fixture.py --check tests` reports anything personal under `tests/`; the pre-commit hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` runs it before a commit exists, CI runs it on every push.

This project enforces strict code quality and packaging standards:

```bash
# Run the complete test suite
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=custom_components.myhome --cov-report=term-missing tests/

# Run containerized Home Assistant smoke test (stable, beta, dev, or all)
python scripts/run_ha_container_smoke.py --channel stable
python scripts/run_ha_container_smoke.py --channel all

# Run OWNd protocol engine smoke test (pinned, latest, dev, or all)
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target pinned
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target all

# Validate PyPI packaging and PEP 517 compliance
python -m build
twine check --strict dist/*
check-wheel-contents dist/*.whl
```

### 🐳 Containerized Smoke Testing

To verify integration installation and runtime cleanliness against official upstream Home Assistant Docker environments before deployment:

```bash
# Test against stable Home Assistant container image
python scripts/run_ha_container_smoke.py --channel stable

# Test against upcoming beta container image
python scripts/run_ha_container_smoke.py --channel beta

# Test across all channels (stable, beta, and dev)
python scripts/run_ha_container_smoke.py --channel all
```

This runner:
1. Pulls the official container (`ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:<channel>`).
2. Runs `hass --script check_config` to validate schemas and component manifests.
3. Automatically installs all integration dependencies (`manifest.json`).
4. Validates clean import of all 14 integration platform modules.
5. Boots Home Assistant in daemon mode and verifies zero exceptions and zero asyncio loop-blocking warnings.

### ⚡ OWNd Protocol Engine Smoke Testing

To verify protocol engine compatibility and prevent regressions across upstream library distributions:

```bash
# Run against pinned PyPI version (manifest.json lockstep)
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target pinned

# Run against latest PyPI pre-release
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target latest

# Run against upstream development branch (OWNd@master)
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target dev

# Test all distribution targets across the matrix
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target all
```

This runner executes 4 validation gates:
1. **Metadata Lockstep**: Verifies that the exact `OWNd==` pin in `manifest.json` matches the installed package.
2. **Golden Corpus Conformance**: Runs 191 OpenWebNet frame fixtures (`tests/test_golden_conformance.py`) verifying parser extraction and builder parity.
3. **Platform Clean Imports**: Verifies all 14 integration platform modules import cleanly without missing symbols or deprecation errors.
4. **Mock Gateway TCP Loopback**: Boots a mock OpenWebNet TCP server, negotiates session handshake (`*99*0##`), dispatches commands, and verifies frame parsing end-to-end.

See the [F454 regression checks](docs/f454-regression-checks.md) for the fixes,
automated coverage and physical gateway verification steps.
