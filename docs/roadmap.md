## 🗳️ Community RFC: How Should We Deal With the Last Remaining Items?

With the foundational architecture and primary subsystems delivered, only a small set of specialized protocol capabilities remains from the original RFC #248 gap analysis. 

We invite community members, certified installers, and power users to review the options below and share their input in [**RFC Discussion #248**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenWebNet-HA/discussions/248):

---

### 1. 💡 P7: Lighting Groups & General Sync (`WHO = 1`)

#### The Technical Context:
In OpenWebNet, lighting actuators can be triggered individually (`WHERE=10`), by group (`WHERE=#1` through `#255`), by environment/room (`WHERE=room`), or generally across the whole plant (`WHERE=0`). 
In ideal installations, actuators broadcast individual status frames (`*1*0*10##`, `*1*0*11##`) after executing a group or general command. However, on older gateways or specific actuator configurations, actuators do **not** emit individual status messages, leaving Home Assistant entities out of sync with the physical lights.

> [!NOTE]
> **Real-World Case Study (Issue #300)**: Installations utilizing DALI gateway interfaces (such as the **F429G**) often group ballasts into SCS groups (`WHERE = #1` .. `#255`) because F429G does not expose native DALI groups. While some modern gateways (such as the F461 in Issue #300) emit individual member status replies, older gateways do not. Currently, software-side grouping using Home Assistant native Light Groups (`light.group`) combined with `myhome_group_light_event` automations for physical wall switches is the officially recommended solution. See [Issue #300](https://github.com/OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME/issues/300) and discussion below.

#### Open Questions for the Community:
1. **Group Mapping Definition**: Should group memberships be defined in `myhome.yaml` / UI Options (e.g. `groups: { 1: ["light.kitchen", "light.dining"] }`), or should Home Assistant trigger an asynchronous status sweep (`*#1*WHERE##`) whenever a group actuation is intercepted on the bus?
2. **Priority**: For your installation, do you actively use physical MyHOME group/general buttons, and are your entity states desynchronizing today?

---

### 2. 🪟 P3: Cover Calibration & Dynamic Hardware Position Promotion (`WHO = 2`)

#### The Technical Context:
Home Assistant currently provides **virtual travel-time positioning** for all covers (calculating percentage open/closed based on configured travel duration). 
Legrand advanced shutter actuators (such as the 67557, LN4672M2, and F401) support native hardware positioning via Dimension 10 (`*#2*WHERE*10*Position*...##`) and an automatic travel calibration routine (`shutterRun=AUTO`).

#### Open Questions for the Community:
1. **Calibration Service**: Would a `myhome.calibrate_cover` service (triggering physical calibration on the actuator) be valuable, or is manual travel-time estimation sufficient and safer?
2. **Auto-Promotion**: Should covers that report Dimension 10 frames automatically promote themselves to hardware positioning mode without user intervention?

---

### 3. 🔒 WHO 14: Actuator Maintenance Locks & Relay Cycle Counters

#### The Technical Context:
OpenWebNet WHO 14 handles actuator diagnostics, relay cycle counters, and hardware maintenance locks (preventing physical buttons from toggling a relay during maintenance or security states). 
Legrand does not publish an open specification for WHO 14; frames are largely proprietary diagnostic codes from DIN actuators.

#### Open Questions for the Community:
1. **Use Case**: Does anyone in the community have a practical automation use case for software maintenance lock switches on Legrand DIN actuators, or does this add unnecessary entity clutter?
2. **Recommendation**: Should WHO 14 remain an internal diagnostic listener (visible in the Bus Monitor card) rather than exposing Home Assistant lock entities?

---

### 4. 🏢 WHO 24: Legrand Commercial Lighting Management Room Controllers

#### The Technical Context:
WHO 24 is designed for commercial Legrand Lighting Management controllers (**BMNE500**, **BMview**, **002645**) used in office buildings and schools. It regulates maintained lux levels, daylight harvesting, and profile activation (`*24*1#Profile*WHERE##`). 
Residential MyHOME plants almost universally use standard WHO=1 lighting and DALI gateways (F429).

#### Open Questions for the Community:
1. **User Base**: Is anyone in the community running commercial BMNE500 / WHO 24 lighting controllers in their installation?
2. **Recommendation**: Should WHO 24 be deferred to an optional extension rather than core residential integration scope?

---

### 5. 🎵 WHO 22: Legacy Multi-Room FM Tuner & RDS Navigation

#### The Technical Context:
WHO 22 defines protocol frames for obsolete Legrand analog FM radio tuner modules (frequency stepping, station presets, and RDS text streaming). 
Modern installations stream digital music from **Music Assistant**, **Spotify Connect**, or AirPlay directly into BTicino audio zones via the **Dynamic Proxy** pattern on the F441 matrix.

#### Open Questions for the Community:
1. **Deprecation**: Should WHO 22 FM tuner controls be formally deprecated in favor of our active F441 Dynamic Streaming Proxy?

---

## 🥇 Phase 5: Home Assistant Integration Quality Scale — Golden Quality Seal (Post-Beta)

Following the conclusion of the beta testing period and community RFC consultation, all engineering efforts will transition to qualifying for the **official Home Assistant 🥇 Golden Quality Seal** ([Home Assistant Integration Quality Scale](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/)) and preparing the codebase for upstream inclusion in Home Assistant Core.

Under Home Assistant's grading architecture, an integration cannot achieve Gold without **100% compliance across all Bronze and Silver rules as well**.

```

### 📋 Detailed Workstream Breakdown

#### 1. 🥉 Bronze Architectural Alignments (Core Prerequisites)
* **`has-entity-name`**: Migrate all entity implementations (`MyHOMEEntity` in `custom_components/myhome/myhome_device.py`) from `self._attr_has_entity_name = False` to `True`. Primary entities (where the device and entity are one, such as a single light actuator or thermostat) will set `_attr_name = None` to inherit the device's friendly name. Remove manual `self.entity_id` overrides to allow Home Assistant Core's registry to handle naming.
* **`runtime-data`**: Deprecate global `hass.data[DOMAIN][mac]` state storage in favor of modern `ConfigEntry.runtime_data` (introduced in HA 2024.4). Establish a typed `MyHomeData` dataclass and `type MyHomeConfigEntry = ConfigEntry[MyHomeData]`.
* **`action-setup`**: Move service action registrations (`sync_time`, `send_message`, `sweep_bus`, `turn_on_timed`) out of `async_setup_entry` into `async_setup` (or a dedicated `services.py`), using standard Home Assistant service targets (`entity_id` / `device_id`) and preventing premature unregistration on entry unload.

#### 2. 🥈 Silver Robustness & Quality Hardening
* **`test-coverage` (>95% per module)**: ✅ **Already Satisfied (Strict 100.0%)**. MyHOME already enforces strict 100.0% statement and branch coverage across all 25 modules (5,155/5,155 statements with 0 missing lines verified by `scripts/verify_ownd_coverage.py` and `tests/test_coverage_enforcer.py`), easily surpassing the Home Assistant >95% requirement.
* **`action-exceptions`**: Update service handlers to raise `homeassistant.exceptions.ServiceValidationError` or `HomeAssistantError` instead of logging errors and returning `False`.
* **`parallel-updates`**: Declare explicit `PARALLEL_UPDATES = 0` (for push-driven event stream entities) or `PARALLEL_UPDATES = 1` (where sequential bus dispatch is needed) across all platform modules (`light.py`, `switch.py`, `cover.py`, `climate.py`, `sensor.py`, `binary_sensor.py`, `media_player.py`, `button.py`, and `alarm_control_panel.py`).

#### 3. 🥇 Gold User Experience & Framework Features
* **`reconfiguration-flow`**: Implement `async_step_reconfigure` in `custom_components/myhome/config_flow.py` allowing users to update the gateway IP, port, or connection mode directly through the UI when network settings change, without deleting and recreating their config entry.
* **`strings.json` & `entity-translations`**: Introduce `custom_components/myhome/strings.json` as the canonical source of truth for translations, and assign `translation_key` across all entities and diagnostic sensors.
* **`icon-translations`**: Add `custom_components/myhome/icons.json` to define standard icons for service actions and state representations rather than hardcoding `_attr_icon`.
* **`repair-issues`**: Integrate Home Assistant's Repairs framework (`homeassistant.helpers.issue_registry.async_create_issue`) for user-actionable situations (such as OWNd engine version mismatches or deprecation warnings for legacy `myhome.yaml` configurations).
* **`quality_scale.yaml`**: Add the official Home Assistant quality scale tracking file (`custom_components/myhome/quality_scale.yaml`) to document rule statuses (`done`, `todo`, `exempt`) and maintain accountability during core review.

#### 4. 🌐 Upstream Ecosystem & Documentation
* **Branding Assets (`brands`)**: Submit official SVG/PNG branding assets (`icon.png`, `icon@2x.png`, `logo.png`, `logo@2x.png`) to the [`home-assistant/brands`](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands) repository.
* **Official Core Documentation**: Author the complete documentation suite for `home-assistant.io/integrations/myhome` fulfilling all 10 Gold documentation standards: data update model, supported hardware matrix, troubleshooting guide, automation examples, known limitations, and removal instructions.

### 📋 Dual-Track Guide: How Community Testers Can Submit a Trace

We offer **two simple ways** to contribute real-world bus traces, tailored to your technical setup:

#### 🏷️ Track A: Zero-CLI via Home Assistant UI (Fastest & Easiest)
Ideal for standard users running Home Assistant with the MyHOME integration:

1. **Sweep the Bus**: In Home Assistant, go to **Developer Tools** > **Services** and call `myhome.sweep_bus` (or trigger it from the Lovelace Bus Monitor Card). This actively queries all lighting, cover, HVAC, and gateway diagnostic states in under 3 seconds.
2. **Download Diagnostics**: Navigate to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **MyHOME** > click the three dots (`⋮`) > **Download diagnostics** (or click **`📋 Export Trace`** on the `<myhome-bus-card>`).
3. **Submit**: Attach the downloaded `.json` file to [**RFC Discussion #248**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenWebNet-HA/discussions/248) or open a GitHub Issue.
4. *Privacy Guarantee*: Home Assistant and MyHOME automatically redact all passwords, authentication tokens, and private credentials before exporting.

#### 💻 Track B: Standalone Python Tool (Test Benches & Integrators)
Ideal for installers, bench testers, and developers testing isolated gateways without Home Assistant installed:

1. **Run the Trace Recorder**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/record_gateway_trace.py --host 192.168.1.35 --password 12345 --model MH202
   ```
2. **Active Sweep & Listen**: The script automatically executes the diagnostic status sweep, listens for ambient button presses or scenario bursts, and scrubs sensitive credentials.
3. **Drop & Commit**: The tool writes a complete ready-to-test fixture folder in `tests/fixtures/plants/<model>_plant/`.
4. **Instant CI Verification**: Run `pytest tests/test_trace_replay.py` — our parameterized test runner automatically discovers and tests your plant with zero additional test code required! Submit a Pull Request.
