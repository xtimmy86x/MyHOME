> [!TIP]
> **🚀 V2 Phase 2 Architecture Now Live**: Phase 2 architecture is active across **OWNd** and **MyHOME**! Featuring strongly typed CEN / CEN+ scenario command builders and device triggers (**P2**), Thermoregulation Central Unit (3550 / 4695) master mode and zone coordination (**P4**), Multi-Gateway routing and physical plant isolation (**P6**), DALI Tunable White support, and 100.0% test coverage verified against the OpenWebNet Golden Corpus.

---

## 🌟 Key Features & Modern V2 Architecture

- **MyHOME Sidepanel (preview)**: An administrator panel available through **Configure → MyHOME panel**, with an optional sidebar shortcut, gateway status, searchable device/entity lists, native Home Assistant name/area editing, reusable profiles with automatic synchronization between tabs, guided opening/closing measurement and deletion of unused profiles for standard covers in WHO 2, and a native bus monitor scoped to the selected gateway. Existing bus cards use a temporary compatibility adapter over the same monitor view. See the [sidepanel guide](docs/sidepanel.md) for scope, installation, and testing.
- **Strongly Typed CEN / CEN+ Device Triggers & Addressing (P2)**: Native Home Assistant UI device triggers for scenario buttons with string-preserved addressing (`"0001"`, `"01"`, `"15"`), enriched event payloads (`where`, `gateway_mac`, `entry_id`), and all 8 press/release/held actions without requiring external YAML blueprints.
- **Native Hardware Bus Light & Switch Timers (`WHO=1`)**: Hardware-offloaded countdown timers executed directly on Legrand DIN actuators (F411, etc.) via `myhome.turn_on_timed` or native `timer`/`duration` parameters in `light.turn_on` and `switch.turn_on`. Supports standard Legrand preset codes (0.5s, 30s, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 15m) and custom Dimension 2 (`*#1*WHERE*#2*H*M*S##`) durations that turn off automatically even if Home Assistant restarts.
- **Real-World Gateway Trace Replay Fixtures in CI (P5)**: Automated pytest fixture engine (`tests/test_trace_replay.py`) replaying frozen on-wire bus captures from production gateways directly against the integration state machine, enabling deterministic bug reproduction and permanent regression defense for community beta testers without requiring physical hardware.
- **Thermoregulation Central Unit Coordination (P4)**: Dedicated master coordination for 99-zone Central Unit (`#0`, model `Central Unit (3550)`) and 4-zone Central Unit (`#0#1`, model `Central Unit (4695)`). Master Heating/Cooling switches (`*4*3xx*#0##`) propagate across internal dispatchers to subordinate zones (`standalone=False`), automatically synchronizing whole-home climate operations with physical central units.
- **Multi-Gateway Routing & Plant Isolation (P6)**: Namespaced event dispatchers (`f"myhome_cen_event_{mac}"`, `f"myhome_central_mode_{mac}"`) and device trigger filtering by parent gateway MAC (`via_device`), eliminating cross-talk and phantom triggers across physical plants combining multiple gateways (e.g. F454 + MH200N / MH201).
- **DALI Tunable White & Color Temperature**: Native support for DALI DT8 ballasts (F429 / F461 gateways) with auto-detection of color temperature (`ColorMode.COLOR_TEMP`, 2000K–6535K / mireds), seamless Kelvin/mireds conversion, and sentinel filtering.
- **Declarative Hardware Profiles**: Auto-detects and tunes connection limits and queue pacing specifically for your gateway model (`MH200`, `MH200N`, `MH202`, `F454`, `F455`, `AM4890`, `MyHomeServer1`, and `Legrand 3578`). Eliminates hardware session exhaustion and buffer overflows.
- **USB / Serial Gateway & OpenZigBee Support**: Native asynchronous transport for the **Legrand 3578 USB/Serial interface** via `pyserial-asyncio` with dynamic port discovery, authentication bypass, and OpenZigBee addressing (`<8-digit id>#9`).
- **Zero-Friction Migration**: Upgrades preserve all existing custom entity IDs (`light.keuken`, `cover.living`) and friendly names. Unique IDs migrate transparently (`MAC-WHERE` → `MAC-WHO-WHERE`) with no broken dashboards or automations.
- **Adaptive Inter-Frame Bus Pacing**: Hardened priority command queue with model-specific inter-frame delays (e.g. 150ms for legacy MH200 vs 20ms for F454) preventing command dropping during heavy automation bursts.
- **Dynamic Bus Auto-Discovery**: Automatically discovers entities from physical bus events and status sweeps without requiring manual `myhome.yaml` configuration. Full support for **F422 cross-bus routing** (e.g. `18#4#02`).
- **Sound System 2.0 & Audio Matrix (WHO=16)**: Complete multi-room audio support for F441 / F441M matrices and amplifiers, including zone power, volume normalization (0–31 scale), software mute emulation, and dynamic streaming proxy.
- **Streaming Audio Dynamic Proxy**: Seamlessly stream from **Music Assistant**, **Spotify Connect**, or any HA media player to wired BTicino audio zones using a thread-safe `DecoderPool` with analog gain-staging.
- **Dimmable Light Detection**: Auto-detects dimming capabilities directly from bus events with transition support.
- **OpenWebNet Golden Corpus Conformance**: Automated unit tests maintaining strict 100.0% line and branch coverage across all component modules, verified against multi-authority real-world captures across 11 OpenWebNet subsystems.

## 📦 Installation & Updating

> [!WARNING]
> **⚠️ Do NOT use HACS to install beta / pre-release versions!**  
> In **HACS 2.0+**, pre-release access was moved to Home Assistant entity switches (`switch.myhome_pre_release`) that are disabled by default. Due to upstream Home Assistant registry caching, enabling these switches frequently gets stuck in an *"unavailable"* loop or reverts to *"disabled"*. Furthermore, because pre-releases are built on the Phase 1 feature branch (`v2-phase1-architecture`) while the default branch is `master`, HACS download validation frequently fails with:  
> `The version 2.0.0b5 for this integration can not be used with HACS`  
> 
> **To avoid frustration, please use Method 1 (Terminal & SSH) or Method 2 (Manual) below — they take less than 10 seconds and preserve all existing devices, entities, and settings 100% safely.**

---

### Method 1: One-Liner via Terminal & SSH Add-on (⭐ Strongly Recommended)

If you have the **Terminal & SSH** add-on enabled in Home Assistant, open **Terminal** from the sidebar and paste this command (press **`Ctrl + Shift + V`** / **`Shift + Ctrl + V`** or right-click to paste into the web terminal):

```bash
cd /config/custom_components
wget -O myhome_beta.zip $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME/releases | grep -m1 -o 'https://[^"]*myhome\.zip')
rm -rf myhome
unzip -q myhome_beta.zip -d myhome
rm myhome_beta.zip
ha core restart
```

*(For **Home Assistant Container / Docker**, run on your Docker host:)*
```bash
docker exec -it homeassistant bash -c 'cd /config/custom_components && wget -O myhome_beta.zip $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/OpenWebNet-HA/MyHOME/releases | grep -m1 -o "https://[^\"]*myhome\.zip") && rm -rf myhome && unzip -q myhome_beta.zip -d myhome && rm myhome_beta.zip'
docker restart homeassistant
```

> [!NOTE]
> All existing entity names, custom entity IDs, and gateway configurations are preserved automatically.

  rm -rf myhome
  unzip -q myhome_legacy.zip -d myhome
  rm myhome_legacy.zip
  ha core restart
  ```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Adding the Gateway

1. Navigate to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **MyHOME**.
3. Choose your gateway type:
   - **Network Gateway (TCP/IP)**:
     - **Auto-Discovery**: The integration automatically discovers UPnP/SSDP-compatible gateways on your local subnet (e.g. F454, MH202, MyHomeServer1). Discovered gateways appear in the Home Assistant UI with standard **Configure** and **Ignore** options, requiring explicit user confirmation before any config entry is created.
     - **Manual IP Setup**: For gateways without UPnP (e.g. MH200), enter the gateway IP address, port (default `20000`), MAC address, and OpenWebNet password (default `12345`).
   - **USB / Serial Gateway (Legrand 3578 / OpenZigBee)**:
     - Select your physical serial device (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `COM3`) from the dynamically populated port picker.
     - Select your baud rate (default `19200`).
     - Serial transport operates with zero authentication overhead (no IP password challenge needed) and natively routes OpenZigBee addresses (`<8-digit id>#9`).
4. Select or confirm your gateway hardware profile from the dropdown.

### Options Flow (Fine-Tuning)

Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → MyHOME → Configure** to fine-tune your installation:
- **Gateway Address & Password**: Update the gateway IP address or OpenWebNet password without recreating the integration.
- **Command Worker Count**: Adjust concurrent command sessions (1 to 10 workers, default 1).
- **Generate Bus Events (`myhome_message_event`)**: Enable firing raw OpenWebNet messages directly to the Home Assistant event bus for custom monitoring and blueprint automations.
- **Light Transition Mode**: Select how brightness transitions are handled:
  - `software_stepped` *(Default & Recommended)*: Smooth 0.3s stepped fades interpolated in software, compatible with all MyHOME dimmers.
  - `native`: Passes through the OpenWebNet hardware speed parameter directly (for supported hardware dimmers).
- **Audio Decoders Pool**: Map network media players (Music Assistant, Spotify Connect, WiiM, Squeezelite) to physical matrix inputs 1–4 with per-source analog pre-gain offsets (0–50%).

---

### 📄 YAML Configuration & Zero-Friction Migration (`myhome.yaml`)

While the integration features **Dynamic Bus Auto-Discovery** that discovers devices automatically from bus events, existing configurations from older versions are 100% supported:

1. **Automatic Search Order**: The integration automatically locates your configuration file in:
   1. `/config/myhome.yaml` *(Standard HA config directory)*
   2. `/config/myhome/myhome.yaml`
   3. Custom component directory fallback
2. **Single & Multi-Gateway Syntax**:
   - Single gateway installations do not require a root MAC header; platforms are mapped automatically to your gateway.
   - Multi-gateway installations group platforms under their respective MAC addresses (`00:03:50:xx:xx:xx`).

```yaml
f454:
  mac: '00:03:50:xx:xx:xx'
  light:
    living_light:
      where: '11'
      name: Living Room Light
      dimmable: True
  cover:
    kitchen_shutter:
      where: '21'
      name: Kitchen Shutter
      travel_time: 22
  alarm_control_panel:
    central_alarm:
      where: '0'
      name: Central Alarm
```

---

### ⚡ Custom Services

The integration registers three specialized services under the `myhome` domain:

| Service | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **`myhome.send_message`** | `gateway` *(optional)*<br>`message` *(required)* | Send an arbitrary, validated OpenWebNet frame (e.g. `*1*0*0##`) directly to the SCS bus. Useful for scripts, custom diagnostic probes, and testing. |
| **`myhome.sync_time`** | `gateway` *(optional)* | Synchronizes the gateway's internal real-time clock with Home Assistant's local time using standard OpenWebNet date/time frames (WHO=13). |
| **`myhome.start_sending_instant_power`** | `entity_id` *(required)*<br>`duration` *(required)* | Requests high-frequency instant active power telemetry (W) from energy management counters (WHO=18) for `duration` seconds. |

---

### 🔔 Event Bus Automation Triggers

The integration fires native events to the Home Assistant event bus for automation triggers:

* **`myhome_cen_event` & `myhome_cenplus_event`**: Pushbutton events from physical CEN (`WHO=15`) and CEN+ (`WHO=25`) scenario controllers. Event payload includes:
  - `object`: Scenario button unit number
  - `pushbutton`: Pushbutton index (0–31)
  - `event`: Trigger action (`pushbutton_short_press`, `pushbutton_short_release`, `pushbutton_long_press`, `pushbutton_long_release`, or rotary dial `rotary_cw_slow`, `rotary_cw_fast`, `rotary_ccw_slow`, `rotary_ccw_fast`)
* **`myhome_alarm_event`**: State transitions emitted by burglar alarm systems (WHO=5), including partition `where`, `state`, `state_code`, and `is_alarm` flag.
* **Broadcast Subsystem Events**: Global and area broadcast commands are mirrored as:
  - `myhome_general_light_event`, `myhome_area_light_event`, `myhome_group_light_event`
  - `myhome_general_automation_event`, `myhome_area_automation_event`, `myhome_group_automation_event`
* **`myhome_message_event`**: When `Generate Bus Events` is enabled in Options Flow, every valid OpenWebNet message received from the gateway is broadcast to the event bus with `gateway` and raw frame `message`.

## 🎵 Multi-Room Audio & Dynamic Proxy

The BTicino sound system matrix (F441 / F441M) is an analog matrix switch. It routes physical source inputs (IN 1–4) to amplified room zones.

This integration includes a **Dynamic Proxy** that lets you stream IP audio (via Music Assistant, Spotify Connect, AirPlay, etc.) directly to your wired BTicino zones.

                                  └──────────────────────┘
```

### Setting Up Streaming

1. Wire your network streamer (e.g. Raspberry Pi running squeezelite, WiiM, Cambridge Audio) to one of the matrix inputs (e.g. Source 1 or 2).
2. In Home Assistant, ensure the streamer is available as a `media_player` entity.
3. Open **MyHOME Options** (`Configure`), navigate to **Decoders**, and specify:
   - **Entity**: The streamer's `media_player` entity ID.
   - **Source**: The physical matrix input number (1–4) it is plugged into.
   - **Pre-Gain**: Analog offset percentage (recommended `15–20%` for line-level DACs, `0%` for fixed pre-amps).
4. Send audio from Music Assistant or Spotify to your BTicino zone entity:
   - The proxy automatically claims the decoder, wakes it, applies gain staging, and activates the zone.
   - When playback stops, the decoder is released back to the pool.

## 📡 Real-Time Bus Monitor & Diagnostics

The integration includes an in-band real-time bus monitor operating over the existing gateway event stream with zero extra socket connections:

### Lovelace Bus Monitor Card (`<myhome-openwebnet-bus-monitor>`)

</p>

A modern custom Lovelace element is automatically registered with zero configuration:

- **Visual Card Picker & GUI Editor**: Fully integrated with Home Assistant's card picker — simply search for **"MyHOME OpenWebNet Bus Monitor"** (or search **"MyHOME"** / **"OpenWebNet"**) under `+ Add Card` and configure the title or buffer size visually without touching raw YAML (YAML type `custom:myhome-openwebnet-bus-monitor`, with `custom:myhome-bus-card` supported as a backward-compatible alias).
- **Live Bus Stream**: High-performance scrolling feed with color-coded badges for subsystems (Lighting `WHO=1`, Automation `WHO=2`, Climate `WHO=4`, Sound `WHO=16`, Energy `WHO=18`, CEN `WHO=15/25`) and ACK (`*#*1##`) / NACK (`*#*0##`) highlighting.
- **Interactive Controls**: Live Pause/Resume, buffer clearing, and instant filtering by subsystem, WHERE address, and Direction (RX/TX).
- **Manual Frame Injector**: Send raw OpenWebNet diagnostic frames directly to the bus with syntax validation.
- **One-Click Diagnostic Bug Reporter**: Click **"📋 Copy Diagnostic Report"** to copy a sanitized, GitHub-ready Markdown bundle containing:
  - Home Assistant Core & integration versions
  - Hardware gateway profile, firmware, connection type, queue pacing, and worker counts
  - Live buffer depth and RX/TX counters
  - Collapsible OpenWebNet bus trace (`<details><summary>OpenWebNet Bus Trace</summary>`)
  - Direct link opening pre-filled GitHub Issue Forms!

> [!TIP]
> **Troubleshooting: Card not showing up or "Custom element doesn't exist"?**
> 
> 1. **Manual Resource Verification**: While the integration automatically registers the card resource, you can verify or manually add it under **Settings ➔ Dashboards ➔ Resources** (click the three dots ⋮ in the top-right corner):
>    - **URL:** `/myhome_static/myhome-bus-card.js`
>    - **Resource Type:** `JavaScript Module`
> 2. **Check for Conflicting HACS Cards**: If custom cards fail to load or the card picker spins indefinitely, inspect your browser console (`F12`). A common cause is conflicting or duplicate custom cards (e.g. having both `scheduler-card` and `lovelace-standalone-schedule-card` installed simultaneously). An uncaught `CustomElementRegistry` collision in an earlier card halts the browser's Lovelace resource-loading pipeline before subsequent cards can initialize. Removing the duplicate card resolves the blockage immediately.
> 3. **Hard Browser Refresh**: After adding resources or updating components, perform a hard refresh (`Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R`) to ensure the browser loads the latest JavaScript bundle from the gateway.

### 📝 Structured GitHub Issue Forms

When reporting issues or requesting new device support on GitHub, interactive forms ensure complete diagnostics:
- **Bug Report**: Gateway profile dropdown, connection type, HA version, diagnostics JSON attachment, and pre-formatted bus trace.
- **Device Support Request**: Structured form for adding new BTicino/Legrand modular components with WHO codes and frame samples.

### 🔍 Native Home Assistant Diagnostics

In addition to the real-time bus monitor card, the integration implements Home Assistant's native diagnostic provider (`diagnostics.py`).
To download a sanitized diagnostic bundle:
1. Navigate to **Settings → Devices & Services → MyHOME**.
2. Click the **three dots (`⋮`)** next to your gateway and select **Download diagnostics**.
3. All sensitive credentials, IP addresses, and tokens are automatically redacted via `CONF_PASSWORD` and `CONF_HOST` anonymizers before being saved to JSON.

### 🧪 Real-World Gateway Trace Replay & Community Issue Reproduction (P5)

A major CI infrastructure enhancement introduced for beta testing is the **Trace Replay Engine** (`tests/test_trace_replay.py`), enabling deterministic bug reproduction and permanent regression defense:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Beta Tester's Real Plant            │
│  (F454, MyHomeServer1, MH202, etc.)  │
└──────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                   │
                   │ 1-Click "📋 Report Issue / Copy Trace" in Bus Monitor Card
                   ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  diagnostic_summary.json             │
│  (100 frozen on-wire frames + config)│
└──────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                   │
                   │ Saved to tests/fixtures/plants/<issue_id>/
                   ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Automated Pytest Replay Engine      │
│  - Replays 100% of frames in order   │
│  - Reproduces bug deterministically  │
│  - Permanent regression protection   │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### How it Works:
1. **Zero Hardware Needed for Bug Triage**: Legrand and BTicino manufacture dozens of gateway models (F454, MyHomeServer1, MH200N, MH202, 3578 USB) and modular DIN actuators with subtle firmware timing variations. When a beta tester reports unexpected behavior, clicking **"📋 Report Issue / Copy Trace"** on the Bus Monitor card (or downloading HA Diagnostics) packages the last 100 on-wire OpenWebNet frames with precise microsecond timestamps.
2. **Automated Discovery & Plant Setup**: Pytest automatically scans `tests/fixtures/plants/*/` for any directory containing `diagnostic_summary.json` and `myhome.yaml`.
3. **Sequential On-Wire Replay**: The harness initializes a simulated gateway session and streams the frozen frames sequentially into Home Assistant's internal event dispatcher (`f"myhome_message_{mac}"`), exercising the exact same message routing path as physical hardware.
4. **End-to-End State Verification**: Verifies that every single frame across Lighting (`WHO=1`), Automation (`WHO=2`), Thermoregulation (`WHO=4`), Audio (`WHO=16`), Energy (`WHO=18`), Dry Contacts (`WHO=25`), and ACK/NACK control signals updates entity states accurately with zero unhandled exceptions.
5. **High-Frequency Stress Testing**: Simulates event storms (e.g. 50 rapid toggle frames) to prove that the integration's async event queue and state machines never drop messages or trigger race conditions.
6. **Permanent CI Regression Protection**: Once a tester's trace is committed, it runs automatically on every pull request and push to master, ensuring that a fix for one community member's installation never regresses in future updates.

#### Capturing Traces:
- **In Home Assistant**: Call service `myhome.sweep_bus` -> Download Diagnostics (or copy trace from Bus Card).
- **Standalone CLI**: Run `python scripts/record_gateway_trace.py --host <IP> --password <PASS> --model <MODEL>` to record an isolated gateway on a test bench directly into a ready-to-test fixture.

#### Privacy: fixtures are synthetic
A diagnostics download describes a home: room and family names in `myhome.yaml`, the LAN address and MAC of the gateway, the config-entry id, sometimes a password. None of that is needed to replay a bus - only the addresses, platforms, options and frames are - so **every fixture is anonymized before it is committed**, and `tests/test_fixture_privacy.py` fails the build if one is not:

```bash
python scripts/anonymize_plant_fixture.py tests/fixtures/plants/issue_<n>_<model>
```

Devices become `light_10` / `Light 10` (the address is the name), IPs move to the `192.0.2.0/24` documentation range, MACs to `00:03:50:00:<issue>`, the entry id to a synthetic one, passwords to `null`. The script prints the old → new entity-id mapping for the test you write against the fixture. Name the directory after the issue and the gateway model, not after the reporter.

## 🛠️ Development & Quality Standards

This project enforces strict code quality and packaging standards:

```bash
# Run the complete test suite
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=custom_components.myhome --cov-report=term-missing tests/

# Run containerized Home Assistant smoke test (stable, beta, dev, or all)
python scripts/run_ha_container_smoke.py --channel stable
python scripts/run_ha_container_smoke.py --channel all

# Run OWNd protocol engine smoke test (pinned, latest, dev, or all)
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target pinned
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target all

# Validate PyPI packaging and PEP 517 compliance
python -m build
twine check --strict dist/*
check-wheel-contents dist/*.whl
```

### 🐳 Containerized Smoke Testing

To verify integration installation and runtime cleanliness against official upstream Home Assistant Docker environments before deployment:

```bash
# Test against stable Home Assistant container image
python scripts/run_ha_container_smoke.py --channel stable

# Test against upcoming beta container image
python scripts/run_ha_container_smoke.py --channel beta

# Test across all channels (stable, beta, and dev)
python scripts/run_ha_container_smoke.py --channel all
```

This runner:
1. Pulls the official container (`ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:<channel>`).
2. Runs `hass --script check_config` to validate schemas and component manifests.
3. Automatically installs all integration dependencies (`manifest.json`).
4. Validates clean import of all 14 integration platform modules.
5. Boots Home Assistant in daemon mode and verifies zero exceptions and zero asyncio loop-blocking warnings.

### ⚡ OWNd Protocol Engine Smoke Testing

To verify protocol engine compatibility and prevent regressions across upstream library distributions:

```bash
# Run against pinned PyPI version (manifest.json lockstep)
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target pinned

# Run against latest PyPI pre-release
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target latest

# Run against upstream development branch (OWNd@master)
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target dev

# Test all distribution targets across the matrix
python scripts/run_ownd_smoke.py --target all
```

This runner executes 4 validation gates:
1. **Metadata Lockstep**: Verifies that `manifest.json` and `const.py` (`REQUIRED_OWND_VERSION`) match the installed package.
2. **Golden Corpus Conformance**: Runs 191 OpenWebNet frame fixtures (`tests/test_golden_conformance.py`) verifying parser extraction and builder parity.
3. **Platform Clean Imports**: Verifies all 14 integration platform modules import cleanly without missing symbols or deprecation errors.
4. **Mock Gateway TCP Loopback**: Boots a mock OpenWebNet TCP server, negotiates session handshake (`*99*0##`), dispatches commands, and verifies frame parsing end-to-end.

See the [F454 regression checks](docs/f454-regression-checks.md) for the fixes,
automated coverage and physical gateway verification steps.
