## 🗳️ Community RFC: How Should We Deal With the Last Remaining Items?

With the foundational architecture and primary subsystems delivered, only a small set of specialized protocol capabilities remains from the original RFC #248 gap analysis. 

We invite community members, certified installers, and power users to review the options below and share their input in [**RFC Discussion #248**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenWebNet-HA/discussions/248):

---

### 1. 💡 P7: Lighting Groups & General Sync (`WHO = 1`) — ✅ Resolved & Shipped

#### The Technical Context:
In OpenWebNet, lighting actuators can be triggered individually (`WHERE=10`), by group (`WHERE=#1` through `#255`), by environment/room (`WHERE=room`), or generally across the whole plant (`WHERE=0`). 
In ideal installations, actuators broadcast individual status frames (`*1*0*10##`, `*1*0*11##`) after executing a group or general command. However, on older gateways or specific actuator configurations, actuators do **not** emit individual status messages, leaving Home Assistant entities out of sync with the physical lights.

#### Delivered Architecture (PRs #367, #376, #377, #391):
Community consensus and engineering converged on a robust two-tier hybrid approach, fully delivered and validated in **v2.0.0b12**:

1. **Truthful Broadcast Event Dispatching (#367)**: `myhome_group_light_event`, `myhome_area_light_event`, and `myhome_general_light_event` report a truthful `event` — strictly `on`/`off` for knowable WHATs, never firing a false `off` for speed, dimming, or toggle frames.
2. **Declared Groups (#376)**: Groups are declared in `myhome.yaml` under `groups:` (`where: '#G'`, optional `members:`), co-located with `lock_features` (#364). When `members` is specified, state is derived dynamically from member lights like `light.group`; otherwise, it operates as an `assumed_state` light.
3. **Centralized FrameRouter Integration (#391)**: `MyHOMELightGroup` implements the standardized `FrameRouter` interface (`handle_event`), enforced by type checking in `MyHOMEEntity` and an automated PR checklist.
4. **Bidirectional Debounced Fallback Sweep (#377)**: A group, area, or general command arms a 250 ms debounce window with per-address cancellation. If individual member statuses echo spontaneously (as confirmed on F461, F429G, F454, and physical MH200 captures), the sweep is cancelled. If individual replies do not arrive within the window, a targeted status sweep (`*#1*#G##` / `*#1*A##`) fires, ensuring complete synchronization without bus congestion.

---

### 2. 🪟 P3: Cover Calibration & Dedicated Administration Panel (`WHO = 2`)

#### The Technical Context:
Home Assistant provides **virtual travel-time positioning** for all covers (calculating percentage open/closed based on configured travel duration).
Legrand advanced shutter actuators (such as the 67557, LN4672M2, and F401) support native hardware positioning via Dimension 10 (`*#2*WHERE*10*Position*...##`) and an automatic travel calibration routine (`shutterRun=AUTO`).

#### Shipped Foundation:
* **Interactive Live Bus Calibration Engine (#302, #319)**: Built-in `myhome.calibrate_cover` service with automatic stopwatch timing directly from on-wire frames, `Calibrate Up` and `Calibrate Down` configuration buttons (`EntityCategory.CONFIG`), `copied_from` timing sharing across identical shutters, and a 60-second hardware cutoff safety guard.
* **Delivery Failure Motion Abort (#380)**: Immediately stops virtual movement and prevents phantom position advance when a cover frame is rejected or unconfirmed by the gateway.

#### Active Community Collaboration: Dedicated Administration Panel (#374):
Work is actively underway in **PR #374** (by @xtimmy86x, following [Discussion #270](https://github.com/orgs/OpenWebNet-HA/discussions/270)) introducing an experimental administration panel:
* **Asymmetric Travel Profiles**: Configurable independent opening and closing durations per cover.
* **Guided & Batch Calibration**: Guided, automatic, and selected-cover batch calibration workflows with explicit preview and atomic persistence.
* **Integrated Diagnostics & Bus Monitor**: Embedded live trace capture, frame filtering, transmission, and diagnostic export directly inside the administration panel.
* **WHO Category Inventory**: Categorized gateway entity inventory with search and area management.

---

### 3. 🔒 WHO 14: Actuator Maintenance Locks & Relay Cycle Counters — ✅ Community Consensus

#### The Technical Context:
OpenWebNet WHO 14 handles actuator diagnostics, relay cycle counters, and hardware maintenance locks (preventing physical buttons from toggling a relay during maintenance or security states). 

#### Community Resolution:
* **Diagnostic Buttons Preserved (#353)**: Actuator lock and unlock controls are exposed as configuration buttons (`button.py`) under `EntityCategory.CONFIG`, allowing maintenance commands without creating cluttering lock entities.
* **Bus Monitor Visibility**: WHO 14 frames remain fully visible, parsed, and color-coded in the Lovelace Bus Monitor card for diagnostic troubleshooting.

---

### 4. 🏢 WHO 24: Legrand Commercial Lighting Management Room Controllers — ✅ Resolved Scope

#### The Technical Context:
WHO 24 is designed for commercial Legrand Lighting Management controllers (**BMNE500**, **BMview**, **002645**) used in office buildings and schools. Residential MyHOME plants almost universally use standard WHO=1 lighting and DALI gateways (F429).

#### Community Resolution:
* **Scope Deferred**: WHO 24 is deferred as an optional standalone extension, keeping core integration scope focused on residential and commercial SCS bus systems.

---

### 5. 🎵 WHO 22: Legacy Multi-Room FM Tuner & RDS Navigation — ✅ Formally Deprecated

#### The Technical Context:
WHO 22 defines protocol frames for obsolete Legrand analog FM radio tuner modules (frequency stepping, station presets, and RDS text streaming). 

#### Community Resolution:
* **Formally Deprecated**: Obsolete analog FM radio controls are formally deprecated in favor of the **Dynamic Streaming Proxy** on the F441 matrix, enabling high-fidelity digital streaming from **Music Assistant**, **Spotify Connect**, and AirPlay directly into wired SCS zones.

---

## 🏆 Phase 5 Achieved: Home Assistant Platinum Quality Scale

Originally planned as an extended post-beta milestone, all requirements for the **Home Assistant Integration Quality Scale** have been **fully implemented and verified ahead of schedule**, elevating MyHOME directly to the **🏆 Platinum Quality Scale** ([Home Assistant Integration Quality Scale](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/)).

Under Home Assistant Core architecture, achieving Platinum requires 100% strict compliance across all Bronze, Silver, and Gold criteria without exception.

#### 1. 🥉 Bronze Architectural Alignments — ✅ 100% Complete (20/20)
* **`has-entity-name = True`**: Fully implemented across all entity platforms (`MyHOMEEntity` in `custom_components/myhome/myhome_device.py`). Primary entities inherit device naming (`_attr_name = None`), and manual `entity_id` assignment has been eliminated in favor of core registry naming (`tests/test_entity_naming.py`).
* **`runtime-data`**: Replaced all legacy `hass.data[DOMAIN]` global state with typed `ConfigEntry.runtime_data` (`MyHOMERuntimeData` in `data.py`), enforced statically by `scripts/verify_ha_standards.py`.
* **`action-setup`**: Service action registrations (`sync_time`, `send_message`, `sweep_bus`, `turn_on_timed`, etc.) are centralized in `services.py` and registered once in `async_setup`, preventing listener teardown during entry reloads.

#### 2. 🥈 Silver Robustness & Quality Hardening — ✅ 100% Complete (10/10)
* **`test-coverage` (100.0% Strict Statement & Branch Coverage)**: Surpasses the core >95% requirement. MyHOME enforces strict 100.0% statement coverage across all integration modules (over 1,700 automated tests passing with zero misses, guarded by `tests/test_coverage_enforcer.py` and CI).
* **`action-exceptions`**: Service actions validate all inputs and raise `homeassistant.exceptions.ServiceValidationError` or `HomeAssistantError` mapped directly to localized translation keys under `exceptions` in `strings.json`.
* **`parallel-updates`**: Declares explicit `PARALLEL_UPDATES = 0` across all platform modules (`light.py`, `switch.py`, `cover.py`, `climate.py`, `sensor.py`, `binary_sensor.py`, `media_player.py`, `button.py`, `alarm_control_panel.py`) for non-blocking local push stream processing.

#### 3. 🥇 Gold User Experience & Framework Features — ✅ 100% Complete (21/21)
* **`reconfiguration-flow`**: Fully supports `async_step_reconfigure` in `config_flow.py` allowing users to update IP address, port, password, or connection mode directly from the Home Assistant UI.
* **`strings.json` & `icon-translations`**: `custom_components/myhome/strings.json` and `icons.json` serve as the canonical source of truth for all entity states, configuration forms, device classes, and service actions.
* **`repair-issues`**: Active integration of Home Assistant's Repairs framework (`async_create_issue`):
  - `gateway_identity_mismatch` & `gateway_identity_corrected`: Proactively informs users if configured model conflicts with WHO=13 hardware telemetry.
  - `unconfigured_timezone` (PR #387): Automatically flags legacy gateway timezone sentinel `999` with remediation guidance.
  - `unknown_model` (PR #388): Captures unmapped WHO=13 hardware codes (`999`) and directs users to diagnostic trace submission.
* **Complete Core Documentation Suite**: Authored all 10 Gold standard documentation chapters under `docs/configuration/` (Architecture, Supported Functions, Gateways, Services, Runtime Behaviour, CEN/CEN+, Sound System, Troubleshooting, Lovelace Recipes, and Known Limitations).
* **`quality_scale.yaml`**: Official compliance manifest actively tracked at `custom_components/myhome/quality_scale.yaml` and verified by `scripts/quality_scale_report.py`.

#### 4. 🏆 Platinum Engineering Tier — ✅ 100% Complete (3/3)
* **`async-dependency`**: The underlying `OWNd` protocol engine (v2.0.0b7) is a 100% non-blocking asyncio library with zero synchronous blocking socket calls.
* **`inject-websession`**: Formally exempt (all communication operates over raw OpenWebNet binary/text TCP streams; no HTTP websession required).
* **`strict-typing`**: Enforces `mypy --strict` with **0 errors across all 30 integration modules**. Cascading type errors were eliminated alongside `OWNd 2.0.0b7`'s PEP 561 `py.typed` marker (PR #393), guarded in CI by `scripts/typing_ratchet.py`.

#### 5. 🌐 Upstream Ecosystem & Core PR Status
* **Branding Assets (`brands`)**: SVG and high-resolution PNG brand assets submitted in [`home-assistant/brands#2052`](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands/pull/2052).

### 📋 Dual-Track Guide: How Community Testers Can Submit a Trace

We offer **two simple ways** to contribute real-world bus traces, tailored to your technical setup:

#### 🏷️ Track A: Zero-CLI via Home Assistant UI (Fastest & Easiest)
Ideal for standard users running Home Assistant with the MyHOME integration:
1. **Sweep the Bus**: In Home Assistant, go to **Developer Tools** > **Services** and call `myhome.sweep_bus` (or trigger it from the Lovelace Bus Monitor Card). This actively queries all lighting, cover, HVAC, and gateway diagnostic states in under 3 seconds.
2. **Download Diagnostics**: Navigate to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **MyHOME** > click the three dots (`⋮`) > **Download diagnostics** (or click **`📋 Export Trace`** on the `<myhome-bus-card>`).
3. **Submit**: Attach the downloaded `.json` file to [**RFC Discussion #248**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenWebNet-HA/discussions/248) or open a GitHub Issue.
4. *Privacy Guarantee*: Home Assistant and MyHOME automatically redact all passwords, authentication tokens, and private credentials before exporting.

#### 💻 Track B: Standalone Python Tool (Test Benches & Integrators)
Ideal for installers, bench testers, and developers testing isolated gateways without Home Assistant installed:
1. **Run the Trace Recorder**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/record_gateway_trace.py --host 192.168.1.35 --password 12345 --model MH202
   ```
2. **Active Sweep & Listen**: The script automatically executes the diagnostic status sweep, listens for ambient button presses or scenario bursts, and scrubs sensitive credentials.
3. **Drop & Commit**: The tool writes a complete ready-to-test fixture folder in `tests/fixtures/plants/<model>_plant/`.
4. **Instant CI Verification**: Run `pytest tests/test_trace_replay.py` — our parameterized test runner automatically discovers and tests your plant with zero additional test code required! Submit a Pull Request.
