# Getting Started & Configuration Overview

This guide walks you through onboarding, configuring, and automating your Legrand / BTicino MyHOME SCS installation with Home Assistant using the **v2.0 UI-first architecture**.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before adding the integration to Home Assistant, ensure:

1. **Network Connectivity**: Your OpenWebNet IP gateway (F454, MyHomeServer1, MH200N/201/202, F453AV) is connected to your local network and powered on.
2. **Fixed IP Address**: A static IP address or permanent DHCP lease reservation on your local router is strongly recommended.
3. **OpenWebNet Password**:
   - For standard gateways (F454, MH201): Note your numeric (4 or 9 digits) or alphanumeric password configured in MyHOME_Suite or TiMyHome.
   - For MyHomeServer1: Note the installer password configured via the MyHOME_Up app.
   - If open LAN authentication is disabled on the gateway, no password is required.
4. **Integration Installed**: The MyHOME custom component is installed (see the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation.md)).

## 🚀 Step 1: Add the Gateway via Config Flow

In v2, gateway setup is **100% UI-first**:

1. In Home Assistant, navigate to **Settings → Devices & Services**.
2. If your gateway is discovered automatically via SSDP or mDNS, click **Configure** on the discovery card.
3. If adding manually:
   - Click **Add Integration** in the bottom right corner.
   - Search for **MyHOME** and select it.
4. Fill in the connection parameters:
   - **Host**: Gateway IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.50`).
   - **Port**: `20000` (default OpenWebNet port).
   - **Password**: Your OpenWebNet or HMAC authentication password.
5. Click **Submit**. Home Assistant will establish the command session (`*99*0##`) and event listening session (`*99*1##`), verify the gateway hardware identity, and create the gateway device entry.

For full parameter specifications and troubleshooting, see [Gateways & Connection Setup](gateways.md).

## 🔍 Step 2: First Bus Discovery & Device Creation

Once connected:

* **Automatic Bus Scanning**: The integration queries the SCS bus across supported subsystems (`WHO = 1, 2, 4, 15, 18, 25`).
* **Device Registry Linking**: Discovered actuators, thermostats, and sensors are automatically grouped and linked to your gateway device via Home Assistant's `via_device_id` registry model.
* **Non-Destructive Transition**: If you have an existing `/config/myhome.yaml` file from v0.9.4, entity names and physical SCS groups (`#G`) are read on startup as a compatibility overlay.
* **Organizing Entities**: Open **Settings → Devices & Services → Entities** to customize entity names, assign rooms/areas (e.g. *Living Room*, *Kitchen*), and set custom icons.

## ⚙️ Step 3: Tune Integration Options

Fine-tune runtime parameters by clicking **Configure** on the MyHOME integration card:

* **Command Worker Concurrency**: Number of asynchronous command workers (default: `1`). Increase to `2`–`4` for high-throughput multi-session gateways like F454 or MHS1.
* **Dimmer Transition Mode**: Choose between `software_stepped` (smooth 100-step software stepping managed by Home Assistant) and `native` (actuator hardware fade ramp).
* **Event Bus Broadcasting**: Toggle whether raw bus frames are emitted as `myhome_event` events to Home Assistant for custom event automations.
* **Dynamic Proxy Decoders**: Map network audio decoders (Music Assistant, Squeezelite) to physical F441 matrix source inputs for Diffusione Sonora.
