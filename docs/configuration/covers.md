# Covers & Shutters (WHO = 2)

The **MyHOME** integration provides full control for motorized shutters, blinds, venetian blinds, and curtains operating on OpenWebNet **WHO = 2**.

In v2, setup and management are **100% UI-first**: entities are automatically discovered from the SCS bus, and position calibration is handled natively through Home Assistant buttons and services without requiring manual YAML configuration files.

## 🚀 Auto-Discovery

When your gateway connects to Home Assistant:

1. **Dynamic Bus Discovery**: The integration listens to OpenWebNet `WHO = 2` frames and scans the bus.
2. **Device Creation**: Each physical shutter actuator (`WHERE = 1..99` or area/point addresses) is registered as a Home Assistant `cover` device linked to your MyHOME Gateway.
3. **UI Customization**: You can rename the entity, assign it to an Area (e.g. *Living Room*, *Master Bedroom*), or change its icon directly in the Home Assistant UI (**Settings → Devices & Services → Entities**).

## 🎛️ Cover Types: Standard vs. Advanced

The integration distinguishes between two types of MyHOME covers:

| Cover Type | Supported Hardware | Position Control (`set_cover_position`) | How Position is Handled |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Advanced Covers** | Legrand Céliane `67557`, Axolute `H4661M2`, Livinglight `LN4661M2`, BTicino `F401` (advanced mode) | ✅ Native | Actuator hardware reports exact physical position back to the bus (`Dimension = 10`). |
| **Standard (Timed) Covers** | Standard relay actuators (`F411/2`, `F411U2`, standard `F401`, older flush-mount units) | ✅ Estimated | Actuator has no position feedback. The v2 runtime estimates position from the elapsed share of the **travel time** (`travel_time_down` and `travel_time_up`). |

> [!NOTE]
> Every discovered cover starts as a **timed** cover. Position-reporting hardware is not detected automatically: set `advanced_shutter: true` for that cover in `/config/myhome.yaml` (see [Troubleshooting → Cover position is wrong](troubleshooting.md#cover-position-is-wrong)). Advanced covers refuse `myhome.calibrate_cover` and `myhome.set_cover_travel_time`, as they do not need a travel time.

## ⏱️ Timed Cover Position Engine

For standard covers without hardware position feedback, the integration provides a software estimator enabling full `open_cover`, `close_cover`, `stop_cover`, and slider-based `set_cover_position` support:

* **Direction-Aware Travel Times**: Because gravity and motor friction cause shutters to fall faster than they rise, the v2 engine tracks separate `travel_time_down` and `travel_time_up` durations (default: `25.0s`).
* **Frame Anchor Timing**: The run timer starts when the direction frame is **written to the gateway**, not when Home Assistant queues it.
* **Echo Suppression**: The gateway relays a momentary stop status (~0.1 s) followed by translation and the actual motor start (~0.55 s). The v2 engine recognizes these as command echoes, re-anchoring the timer to the true motor start rather than falsely treating them as manual stop commands.
* **Resynchronization**: Running a cover to its full travel limit (fully open or fully closed) automatically resets any minor timing drift to 0% or 100%.

> [!WARNING]
> **Half the time is not half the height.** The estimate is linear: 50 % means the motor ran for half of the stored travel time. A roller shutter does not move at constant speed — coming down from the top the curtain runs fast on a full roll and is well past the middle at half time; going up from the bottom the first seconds go into gathering the slats and the curtain barely moves. Measured on a 107 cm shutter with exact travel times: `set_cover_position: 50` stopped at 27 cm from the sill coming down and at 37 cm going up, against a true midpoint of about 53 cm, while Home Assistant reported 50 % both times. The end positions (0 % / 100 %) are exact; intermediate positions are approximate and differ by direction. Treat the slider as "roughly there", not as a measurement — this applies to calibrated and manually set times alike.

## 📐 Calibrating Travel Time (Zero YAML)

You never need to edit YAML files to calibrate travel times in v2.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Actuator Requirements for Automated Calibration**
> Automated on-bus calibration relies entirely on the actuator emitting a stop frame (`*2*0*<WHERE>##`) at the moment the shutter physically reaches its end stop.
>
> * **Trimmed Actuators**: If the installer trimmed the actuator's mechanical or potentiometer run-time limit to match the physical shutter, automated calibration will measure your shutter travel times accurately down to tenths of a second.
> * **Factory 60 s Cutoff Actuators**: If the actuator run-time was left at the factory default cutoff (~60 s), the actuator will not stop when the shutter reaches the bottom; it will continue running until the 60 s hardware timer expires. The integration detects this condition and **safely rejects the calibration** to prevent saving inaccurate 60 s run times. For these actuators, use [Method 3: Set Explicit Travel Time via Service Action](#method-3-set-explicit-travel-time-via-service-action) instead.
>
> **How to spot your case**: press the button once and watch the first (opening) run. If the motor keeps running for about a minute after the shutter is fully up, your actuator is at its factory limit and cannot be measured over the bus — the button will refuse every time. You will not see the refusal in the UI (the button does not wait for the result): it is logged, and the `myhome_cover_calibration` event reports `phase: failed`. Nothing is stored.
>
> **Which actuators** (from the datasheets, not yet verified on hardware): the `F411/2`, `F411/4` and `F411U2` have a configurable timed stop — the physical *M* configurator, or 1–60 s in MyHOME_Suite. Set it equal to the real travel and these become measurable; a run that ends at ~60 s most likely means it was left at its default. The `F401` and the `H4661M2` / `LN4661M2` family learn the real travel themselves (*Push&Learn*), which is the case where the end stop on the bus is genuine.

### Method 1: Automated Calibration Button on Device Page
Every cover device in Home Assistant includes a dedicated configuration button entity (on a position-reporting cover a press is refused, as there is nothing to measure):

* **Entity**: `button.<name>_calibrate_travel_time`
* **Icon**: `mdi:ruler-square-compass`

When you click **Calibrate Travel Time**, the integration performs a fully automated 3-step calibration sequence on the bus:

1. **Full Open (Reference Sync)**: The shutter is driven fully **UP** to reach the mechanical top limit, establishing a reliable reference position.
2. **Full Close (Timed)**: After a brief settling pause, the shutter is driven fully **DOWN**. The integration monitors the OpenWebNet bus to precisely record `travel_time_down` (from motor start to actuator stop frame).
3. **Full Open (Timed)**: After another pause, the shutter is driven fully **UP** back to the top limit, recording `travel_time_up`.
4. **Saved Automatically**: Both measured times are persisted into Home Assistant's config entry (`cover_travel_times`) and shown as the cover's `travel_time_down` / `travel_time_up` attributes, with `calibration_source: measured` and a `calibrated_at` timestamp. The shutter ends in the 100% open position. Progress is published on the event bus as `myhome_cover_calibration` (`phase`: `queued`, `start`, `run`, `done`, `failed`), so you can follow or automate on it.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * **Do not press the button a second time**: The sequence is fully automated. A second press while the run is active is refused (*"… is already being calibrated"*); the button fires the action without waiting for it, so the refusal only shows up in the Home Assistant log, not in the UI. Each run also gives up with *no stop status from the actuator* if no stop frame arrives within 180 s.
> * **Do NOT stop the shutter during calibration — neither from the cover entity nor from the wall**: A stop press from either place puts a plain stop frame (`*2*0*<WHERE>##`) on the bus, which is the very same frame the actuator emits when the shutter reaches its end stop. The integration cannot tell them apart, so it treats the stop as the end of the run and stores the partial elapsed time (e.g. 5–6 seconds) as the calibrated travel time.
> * **How to Abort Safely**: The one safe way out is the `myhome.stop_cover_calibration` action in **Developer Tools → Actions**: it marks the run as interrupted and stores nothing. Call it while the shutter is moving — a call that lands in the one-second pause between two runs is not seen and the next run starts. (Driving the shutter in the *opposite* direction from the wall is also recognised as an interruption, because it arrives as an explicit open/close command rather than a stop — but prefer the action.)

### Method 2: Calibrate All Covers Sequentially
On your gateway device page, click **Calibrate All Covers** (`button.<gateway name>_calibrate_all_covers`, e.g. `button.f454_gateway_calibrate_all_covers`). It calls `myhome.calibrate_cover` for every enabled cover of that gateway; a per-gateway lock runs them **one at a time**, because two motors moving on one paced session would make the timings meaningless. Covers still waiting report `phase: queued`. Position-reporting (advanced) covers are refused with an error in the log and the others continue. `myhome.stop_cover_calibration` stops the running cover and drops the whole queue.

### Method 3: Set Explicit Travel Time via Service Action
If your actuators enforce the 60-second factory cutoff, if your gateway is single-session (such as MH200 / MH200N), or if you already know the exact run duration (e.g. from a handheld stopwatch or technical datasheet), set it directly using the `myhome.set_cover_travel_time` action in **Developer Tools → Actions**.

You rarely need a handheld stopwatch: the integration times **every** run of a timed cover, calibration or not, and exposes the result as plain entity attributes — no card required.

1. Open the cover in Home Assistant (or use its wall switch) and press **Close**.
2. Press **Stop** (entity or wall switch) the moment the shutter reaches the bottom end stop.
3. Go to **Developer Tools → States**, filter on the cover entity: `last_run_seconds` is the motor-start-to-stop time of the run you just made and `last_run_direction` says `close`. The same attributes are listed under **Attributes** in the cover's more-info dialog.
4. Repeat with **Open** for the up time, then pass both numbers to the action (or put the attributes and a **Save** button on your dashboard with [Lovelace Recipe 6](lovelace_recipes.md#recipe-6-shutter-travel-time-workbench-stock-cards-only)):

```yaml
action: myhome.set_cover_travel_time
target:
  entity_id: cover.living_room_shutter
data:
  travel_time_down: 22.5
  travel_time_up: 24.0
```

The result is stored exactly like a measured calibration, with `calibration_source: manual`, and overwrites whatever a previous calibration attempt may have saved (also visible under `cover_travel_times` in the integration's diagnostics download). When the numbers you pass were measured on an identical shutter, add `copied_from: cover.<other_shutter>` to record where they came from; `calibration_source` then reads `copied` and the entity is exposed as a `copied_from` attribute.

To forget the measured or manual times and return to the `travel_time` from `myhome.yaml` (or the 25 s default when none is configured):
```yaml
action: myhome.reset_cover_travel_time
target:
  entity_id: cover.living_room_shutter
```

## 🔄 Legacy YAML Note

> [!NOTE]
> If you are upgrading from legacy v0.9 installations and still have manual `cover:` blocks in `/config/myhome.yaml`, please refer to the [v0.9.4 Legacy Cover Documentation](../../0.9.4/configuration/covers/) or the [Legacy YAML Migration Guide](../migration/legacy-yaml.md). In v2, all covers are managed dynamically via Home Assistant's native registry.
